👋 Hey there! I'm @Kevin-Santos15  
👀 I'm passionate about Python programming, especially building custom modules and automation scripts.  
🌱 Currently, I'm honing my skills in advanced Python, Django for web development, and Odoo module customization.  
🚀 Data Analytics & Power BI
I'm specializing in Power BI, turning raw data into actionable insights. From data cleaning and modeling to **interactive dashboards**, I optimize data visualization and analytics to drive better decision-making. Data tells a story, and I love making it come to life!
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source Python projects, Odoo module development, and anything related to data analysis with Python.  
📫 Reach out to me via GitHub or email at kevin.santos@example.com.  
😄 Pronouns: He/Him/Matrix  
⚡ Fun fact: I love debugging complex code—it's like solving a puzzle!
